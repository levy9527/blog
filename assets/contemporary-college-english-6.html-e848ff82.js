Ideals refer to the long-run goals<br> of a nation and the spirit in which these goals are pursued. Ideology is something different, more systematic, more<br> detailed, more comprehensive, more dogmatic.</p><p>An ideology, in other words, is an abstraction from reality. There is nothing wrong with abstractions or models. In<br> fact, we could not conduct discourse without them. The ideological fallacy is to forget that ideology is an abstraction<br> from reality and to regard it as reality itself. The besetting sin of the ideologist, in short, is to confuse his own<br> tidy models with the vast, turbulent, unpredictable, and untidy reality which is the stuff of human experience.</p><p>Consider for a moment the ideologist&#39;s view of history. The ideologist contends that the mysteries of history can be<br> understood in terms of a clear-cut, absolute, social creed which explains the past and forecasts the future. Ideology<br> thus presupposes a closed universe whose history is determined, whose principles are fixed, whose values and objectives<br> are deducible from a central body of social dogma and often whose central dogma is confided to the custody of an<br> infallible priesthood.</p><p>The American tradition has found this view of human history repugnant and false, against the belief in the<br> all-encompassing power of a single explanation, against the commitment to the absolutism of ideology, against the notion<br> that all answers to political and social problems can be found in the back of some sacred book, against the<br> deterministic interpretation of history.</p><p>Ideologists are afraid of the free flow of ideas, even of deviant ideas within their own ideology. They are convinced<br> they have a monopoly on the Truth. Therefore they always feel that they are only saving the world when they slaughter<br> the heretics. Their objective remains that of making the world over in the image of their dogmatic ideology. The goal is<br> a monolithic world, organized on the principle of infallibility-but the only certainty in an absolute system is the<br> certainty of absolute abuse.</p><p>The goal of free men is quite different. Free men know many truths, but they doubt whether any mortal man knows the<br> Truth. Their religious and their intellectual heritage join in leading them to suspect fellow men who lay claim to<br> infallibility. They believe that there is no greater delusion than for man to mistake himself for God. They accept the<br> limitations of the human intellect and the infirmity of the human spirit.</p><h2 id="notes-on-the-english-character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notes-on-the-english-character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notes on the English Character</h2>',8),j={href:"https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415017440",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},P=e("p",null,"本文对英格兰人的性格特征进行了简单的探讨。",-1),F=e("h2",{id:"the-death-of-a-pig",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#the-death-of-a-pig","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" The Death of a Pig")],-1),H={href:"https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415019607",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},L=e("p",null,"本文主人公本计划养一只猪来吃，却养死了。为何把这篇文章收录进来呢，可能是因为里面细节写得好吧，把主人公的病急乱投医的场景写得较为生动。",-1),V=e("h2",{id:"don-t-eat-fortune-s-cookie",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#don-t-eat-fortune-s-cookie","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" Don't Eat Fortune's Cookie")],-1),M={href:"https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415020743",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},z=e("p",null,"Princeton学长回校演讲，核心观点是：你以为你的成功全靠实力，然而其中隐含着运气。",-1),G=e("h2",{id:"the-accidental-universe",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#the-accidental-universe","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" The Accidental Universe")],-1),O={href:"https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415022329",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},S=e("p",null,"本文是物理相关的说明文，讲了多重宇宙假设，提出一种观点：我们所在的宇宙是出于偶然。",-1),Y=e("h2",{id:"rowling-s-speech-at-harvard",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#rowling-s-speech-at-harvard","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" Rowling's Speech at Harvard")],-1),J={href:"https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415018537",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},R=e("p",null,"罗琳的英音很好听，而且本次演讲也很幽默，建议边看边听。",-1);function U(K,Q){const o=r("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),h("div",null,[d,c,e("p",null,[t("全书链接："),e("a",u,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/album/49468954"),a(o)])]),p,f,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",m,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/414998175"),a(o)])]),w,e("p",null,[t("注：Chua"),b,t(" 也就是《虎妈战歌》的作者："),e("a",y,[t("https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%94%A1%E7%BE%8E%E5%84%BF/3424632#7"),a(o)])]),g,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",_,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/414999846"),a(o)])]),x,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",k,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415001340"),a(o)])]),v,T,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",A,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415004615"),a(o)])]),E,C,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",I,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415006607"),a(o)])]),q,B,D,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",N,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415007539"),a(o)])]),W,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",j,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415017440"),a(o)])]),P,F,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",H,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415019607"),a(o)])]),L,V,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",M,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415020743"),a(o)])]),z,G,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",O,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415022329"),a(o)])]),S,Y,e("p",null,[t("原文链接："),e("a",J,[t("https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/415018537"),a(o)])]),R])}const $=i(l,[["render",U],["__file","contemporary-college-english-6.html.vue"]]);export{$ as default};
