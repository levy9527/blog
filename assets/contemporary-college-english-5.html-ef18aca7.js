So you have to trust<br> that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something-your destiny,life,whatever. Because<br> believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads<br> you off the well-worn path. And that would make all the difference.</p><p>Sometimes life is gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don&#39;t lose faith. I&#39;m convinced that the only thing that kept<br> me going was that I loved what I did. You&#39;ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for<br> your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what<br> you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&#39;t found it yet, keep<br> looking, and don&#39;t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you&#39;ll know when you find it. And like any great<br> relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don&#39;t settle.</p><p>I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: &quot;If today were the last day of my life,would I want to do<br> what l am about to do today?&quot; And whenever the answer has been &quot;No&quot; for too many days in a row, l know I need to change<br> something. Remembering that I&#39;ll be dead soon is the most important tool I&#39;ve ever encountered to help me make the big<br> choices in life. Because almost everything-all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or<br> failure-these things just fall away in the face of death,leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are<br> going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
